        shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot.
  Though the human foot can adapt to varied terrains and climate conditions, 
  it is vulnerable, and shoes provide protection. Form was originally tied to 
  function but over time shoes also became fashion items. Some shoes are worn as
  safety equipment, such as steel-toe boots, which are required footwear at industrial worksites.

Additionally, fashion has often evolved into many different designs, 
such as high heels, which are most commonly worn by women during fancy occasions. 
Contemporary footwear varies vastly in style, complexity and cost. Basic 
sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for 
a low cost. High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive
 materials, use complex construction and sell for large sums of money. Some shoes
  are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering
   or skiing, 
while others have more generalized usage such as sneakers which have transformed from 
a special purpose sport shoe into a general use shoe. </p></div>
